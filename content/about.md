---------------------------
Hi, I'm Chris. I am a Hacker, Engineer and Geek. I have a passion for all things Cyber Security, but my main areas of focus are in Hardware "hacking" (making and breaking) and the Cloud. You can never know everything, but knowledge is power; so I always strive to learn something new as often as family, life and work allow.

I am also a motorcyclist and boulderer when not chasing around after 2 kids and my darling wife. Recently, I have taken the first steps in getting out and about with FPV Drones, not for racing but freestyle; in particular the camera footage you can get with them while pulling some insane stunts. One day I would love to have the abilities with a drone that people like [JohnnyFPV](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7O8KgJdsE_e9op3vG-p2dg) have.
