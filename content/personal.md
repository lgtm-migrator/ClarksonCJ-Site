---------------------------
Hi, I'm Chris. I am a Hacker, Engineer and Geek. I have a passion for all things Cyber Security, but my main areas of interest are in Purple teaming and the Cloud. You can never know everything, but knowledge is power; so I always strive to learn something new as often as family, life and work allow.

I am also a motorcyclist and boulderer when not chasing around after 2 kids and my darling wife. Recently, I have taken the first steps in getting out and about with FPV Drones, not for racing but freestyle; in particular the camera footage you can get with them while pulling some insane stunts. One day I would love to have the abilities with a drone that people like [JohnnyFPV](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7O8KgJdsE_e9op3vG-p2dg) have.
